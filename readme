## **Installation and Setup**

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **MongoDB** installed locally or use a cloud instance ([MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd quiz-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # For backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_db_connection_string>
     JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
     PORT=5000
     ```
4. Run the Application:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```
5. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
